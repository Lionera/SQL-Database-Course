- Relational Database Management System -> Software we can use to manage a database
- MySQL to write SQL code & queries to create databases, tables, input information, retrieve information
- Design database schemas -> Consists of all the different tables & relations that will be stored

~ What is a database (DB)?
  - Any collection of related information that can be stored in different ways
~ Database Management System (DBMS)
  - A special software program used to help users create and maintain a DB
    - Allows management of large amounts of information
    - Security
    - Backups
    - Importing/Exporting data
    - Concurrency
    - Interacts with Software Applications
      - Programming Lanaguages

~ C.R.U.D --> Create, Read, Update, Delete
  - these are the four main operations working with databases

~ 2 Types of Databases
  1.) Relational Databases (SQL)
    - Each tables has columns & rows
    - A unique key identifies each row
  2.) Non-Relational (noSQL / not just SQL)
    - Key-value stores
    - Documents (JSON, XML, etc.)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible Tables
